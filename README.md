This project is an example of my work.
The goal was to create a list of plant and animal species found within my region that fit within a few parameters of conservation status, resulting in a list of species with priority for conservation. 

If downloaded as the full folder of documents, it should run after the necessary libraries have been installed. The `here` library will guide the user to the correct folders for data. 
Please feel free to message me with any questions, comments, feedback, etc.

thanks for checking it out!
Adrienne
